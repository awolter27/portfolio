    "bio": "I'm currently navigating a career pivot from the healthcare industry to the technology sector. For the past 6+ years, I've served as a physician assistant across a range of disciplines, including family medicine, internal medicine, urgent care, and occupational health. While I enjoy practicing medicine, I am ready for a new challenge outside of the medical field. At the start of this year, I began an immersive software engineering program at General Assembly. I have gained 500+ hours of hands on experience in both the front-end and back-end of web applications. Iâ€™m excited to begin the next phase of my career and would love to connect with you!"
